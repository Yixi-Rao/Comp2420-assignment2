    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment-2-uXXXXXXX.ipynb` (where uXXXXXXX is your uid) \n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. Any variation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them.\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* Your code answers will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Your written answers will be marked on the **correctness**, **depth** and **clarity** of your written answers. If your marker cannot understand your answer, marks may be deducted\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",
    "* For written responses, a word limit of 300 words per question applies. There is no minimum word count. After 300 words, the tutors will stop reading your response, marking what has already been said.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction has been split into three sections, based on the datasets you will be interacting with: **CVE revisited**, **BikeStores**, and **Rumble**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### CVE revisited\n",
    "Sound familiar? We hope so. You are being provided another sample of the NVD CVE dataset from the first assignment, although for a different year. For a refresher, go check the [about.md](./data/cve/about.md) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### BikeStores\n",
    "To test your SQL muscles, we have provided a database (and the creation scripts) for a sample SQL database called [BikeStores](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-sample-database/). The BikeStores database is modeled off a retail store selling bicycles. We have provided the Database diagram in Q3 for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rumble\n",
    "One of the goals of this course was to introduce you to a multitude of different scenarios and datasets, and this assignment will be no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WWE Royal Rumble (Further Reading: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble) or [wwe.com](https://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble)) is an annual [professional wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling) event put on by the [World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE). At the event, the marque match is a 30-man (or now woman!) \"battle royale\". (If none of this makes sense, don't worry. We're about to explain it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is professional wrestling?\n",
    "Professional Wrestling is a form of entertainment, quite popular in the United States and Japan. \"Wrestlers\" will \"fight\" in \"matches\", which are aimed to combine theater and athleticism. Matches are predetermined, participants are all willing, and the main aim is to entertain the audience. ([Further Reading](https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what is a \"Royal Rumble\"?\n",
    "The \"Royal Rumble\" is a type of match that has 3 rules:\n",
    "- Everyone gets allocated an entrance number (so, you start with 2 and new entries come in every so often).\n",
    "- Only way to get rid of someone is to throw them out of the ring.\n",
    "- Last person standing wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So, what has this got to do with the assignment?\n",
    "Good question! All of the above is background information so you understand the dataset. In the interests of assessing your data handling, manipulation and SQL skills, you are going to be implementing an SQL database from the csv data files provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "*****\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "You have three (3) datasets to work with in this assignment, broken down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 1 - CVE\n",
    "- Question 3 - BikeStores\n",
    "- Question 4 - Rumble\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the CVE dataset is a sizable dataset (roughly 8000 rows and 24 columns), so it is wise to consider your code in terms of complexity to ensure it doesn't take 30 minutes to run a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reading on the datasets can be found in the following locations:\n",
    "- [CVE about.md](./data/cve/about.md)\n",
    "- [BikeStores about.md](./data/bikestores/about.md)\n",
    "- [Rumble about.md](./data/rumble/about.md)\n",

    "\n",

    "Your scenario is as follows:\n",
    "> Once again, you have assumed the role of a member of a cyber-security team interested in the vulnerability of products. One of your colleagues developed a heuristic that could be used to group CVE entries into relative risk groups that highlight which vulnerabilities need to be patched in products. While this is useful for determining which vulnerabilities should be patched for products that are already within the system, your software procurement team wants to know if there are any products to avoid when buying new products. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your procurement team has asked you to develop an automated modelling system (ie: clustering model) to identify software that can be grouped based on their risk. You must decide how many groupings, and what risk level (for example, High, Medium or Low) is appropriate for each group. Risk could be based on the number of CVEs and CVSS v2 metrics that can be associated to a product. The procurement team does not wish to use the CVSS Base Score metric as a clustering metric. They are also only interested in products with more than 3 entries, otherwise they predict there will be bias in the results. Finally, they are only interested in using the CVSS v2 system. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Based on this clustering model, the procurement team will make risk-based decisions to determine whether it is safe to introduce a product to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first be asked to import and pre-process the data ready to implement a clustering model. Then, you are on your own in the world of clustering. Good luck!"

    "    This model could be used by sending the cvss metrics to the model and predict it, and then check which cluster is the product belongs, then if the risk level is very high in that cluster, therefore the purshased should not be purchased, for example a product (cvss v2 metric is low,network,none,partial,partial,partial respectively ) should belong to medium risk level."

In your induction, you discover Blume works with a number of government and private industry organisations in data handling processes, while maintaining a copy of the data. This data is then collected, analysed and indiscriminately sold on to a number of other organisations who have used the data to perform a number of questionable practices. These practices include: adjusting prices of health insurance premiums based on a person's eating habits, adjusting rent prices based on income, predictive policing, and selective advertising. \n",

    "    The potential ethical issues is 'Weblining' and 'Unfair Discrimination' and 'The Digital Surveillance Economy'. For example, the pratice of predictive policing will cause 'Unfair Discrimination' because someone will be arrested depending on his colour of skin or the gender and the 'Weblining' issue is caused by adjusting prices of health insurance premiums based on a person's eating habits, adjusting rent prices based on income 'The Digital Surveillance Economy' is caused by selective advertising.\n",
    "    Property Damage and Financial Loss  will arise when the 'Weblining' happens, since some people who are fat will spent more money on health insurance premiums, and some people who have a high income will pay more rent. Reputation or Conﬁdence Loss will arise when 'predictive policing' arrest the wrong person due to discrimination.  "

    "## Q4: Dubious Databases (25 marks)\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You've been successful in your application as a database developer for an unnamed wrestling company. Your managers wish to understand why it is so difficult to search through the results of past events, and to your surprise, you find all the results as .csv files on your computer. The previous database developer never bothered to make a database, and manually kept track of all the information of the events - making it very difficult for quick searches. You've been tasked with building a database for the company to use to fix this. Rather than starting from scratch, you're hoping you can use the event results to start filling in information. The first folder you find is called `rumble`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is as follows:\n",
    "- Design a database to meet the requirements specified below.\n",
    "- Draw a simple ER diagram showing the relationship between the tables.\n",
    "- Implement the database in an SQLite database.\n",
    "- Import the csv files from the `rumble` folder and enter the data into the database.\n",
    "- Complete the final search request as described by your manager below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the requirements brief that was provided to you by your manager in an email:\n",
    "> Afternoon newbie,\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Our company runs a really special match called the *Royal Rumble* but so far, we haven't been keeping digital records of it very well. We've been running it for a while, so a lot of it is paper-based, but the previous database developer had stored it all in text files which you should have access to.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So basically, the company is built on events, which we run once a year. An event would normally have a title, year, location, and attendance; although we may have to enter some of that information by ourselves later.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Each event has a series of matches. Initially we only ran one match at each event, but lately we've been doing one for males and one for females. A __match__ has the following attributes:\n",
    "> - a title, \n",
    "> - list of participants, \n",
    "> - how long each respective participant was in the match, \n",
    "> - how many people they eliminated, \n",
    "> - one winner, and \n",
    "> - how long the match went for. \n",
    ">Some other organisations rate their matches, although I don't like that so don't worry about that aspect.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Finally, the __wrestlers__ or __participants__ will have the following attributes:\n",
    "> - a stage name, \n",
    "> - real name, and \n",
    "> - gender. \n",
    "> \n",
    ">We will have to enter a lot of this information later, but at least we can enter in the information we have. You can just assume the records contain the stage name, not the real name.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Don't worry about formatting issues; for example, if a wrestler's name is \"*Mankind*\" one year, then \"*Cactus Jack*\" another year, and \"*Dude Love*\" the year after, you can just pretend they're different wrestlers. People change their names all the time. Similarly, if the previous database designer entered a wrestler as \"*D'Lo Brown*\" in one place and \"*DLo Brown*\" in another place, you can also pretend that's two wrestlers. We'll fix that up manually later.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After you've done all that, can you show me the match title and duration of all the events that Steve Austin won? I believe he goes by \"*Stone Cold Steve Austin*\" and \"*Steve Austin*\".\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Good luck!\n",
    "> Adam Cole\n",

We will only be able to clarify any errors or unreasonably ambiguous details. Remember to state all assumptions beforehand.\n",

    "> Gizmo Technologies has outsourced some work to Tom and Alice, and needs to get them to jointly sign a contract for the work. Since the parties involved are located in different parts of the world, and this is a frequently occurring scenario, Gizmo Technologies decides to come up with a method for doing this electronically. The contract has to be signed by both Tom and Alice. We assume that the contract is transmitted electronically over public channels, so integrity and confidentiality have to be assured. Both Tom and Alice need to be assured that they are both signing the same contract and need to have a copy of the signed contract. The contract needs to be non-repudiable and the process has to be efficient.\n",

    "6. Then Tom using the Alice's public key to encrypt the DES secret key(in step 5). And Tom sents the encrypted 'DES key' and all the encrypted 'message'(in step 5) to Alice\n",
    "7. Alice receives all the stuff, she fisrt uses her private key to decrypt the encrypted 'DES key' to get the secret key and uses it to decrypt the all the encrypted 'message'(in step 5). And ALice finally gets the contract and signatures.\n",
